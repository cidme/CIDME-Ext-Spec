CIDME Recommended Extensions Specification

These are recommended extensions to use with the [CIDME Core specification](http://github.com/CIDME/CIDME-Core-Spec).  These extensions implement helpful functionality in a standardized way.  Not all projects may wish to use these extensions, which is why they were separated from the core specification and put into their own.

**_NOTE:_** The CIDME Recommended Extensions specification is currently under active internal development and is not currently ready for release.  However, the the alpha-level vocabulary can be found in the [_gh-pages_ branch of the CIDME/CIDME project](https://github.com/cidme/CIDME/tree/gh-pages).  HTML and JSON files may also be somewhat-navigated by browsing the [CIDME.net website](http://cidme.net).
